
My roadmap and planning for my current project.

The aim is to create a simple git-like system, where i can commit, pull, and push projects.

I don't need a UI to actually view anything, as i'm working on Django and learning it atm, so i'll just incoporate it into Django when i'm ready

for now my goals are to just lay down the basics, using git as a template/roadmap to follow:

1. Create a file-storing system:
    - I will be creating Blobs (Binary large object) which store all the data
    - I need to be able to access/save these at will

2. Above will need to be stored into folders and saved efficiently.
    - I'll create a tree-structure to sort everything efficiently

3. And a basic repo to commit/pull at will

I'll be creating unittests for all the above, and eventually work it into Django
